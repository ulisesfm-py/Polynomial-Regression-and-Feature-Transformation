# Polynomial Regression and Feature Transformation
This project explores polynomial regression models and the impact of feature transformations, such as sine functions, on model fitting.

The code fits polynomial regression models of various degrees to datasets and visualizes the results. It examines how incorporating polynomial terms and sine transformations affects the model's ability to fit the data.

## Features
* Fits polynomial regression models of specified degrees
* Optionally includes sine transformations in the feature set
* Visualizes the fitted models against training data
* Works with provided large and small datasets

## Dependencies
* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
